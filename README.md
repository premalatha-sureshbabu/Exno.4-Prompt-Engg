### Aim: 
Scenario-Based Report Development Utilizing Diverse Prompting Techniques

### Algorithm:  
The goal of this experiment is to design and develop an AI-powered chatbot that can handle customer inquiries, provide support, and improve customer experience in a retail environment. Create prompts using various AI prompting techniques to guide your experiment, data collection, analysis, and report creation

### Prompts:
### 1. Straightforward Prompt:
For handling common customer inquiries, a straightforward approach works well, such as responding to queries about post content, hashtags, or account-related issues.

Example Prompts and Responses:

Customer Query 1: "How can I delete a post?"

Chatbot Response: "To delete a post, go to your profile, select the post, and click the three dots in the corner. From there, select 'Delete.' Let me know if you need further assistance."

Customer Query 2: "What is the best time to post?"

Chatbot Response: "The best time to post depends on your audience, but generally, it's between 9 AM and 12 PM, and 7 PM to 9 PM, as that's when most people are online."

### 2. Tabular Format Prompting:
For comparing social media platforms, trends, or analyzing post performance, tabular format is a great way to present structured data.

Example Prompts and Responses:

Customer Query: "Can you compare the post reach between Facebook and Instagram?"
chatbot response:
\| **Platform** | **Average Reach** | **Best Posting Time** | **Target Audience** |
\|--------------|-------------------|-----------------------|---------------------|
\| **Facebook** | 50,000 - 100,000  | 9 AM - 12 PM          | Ages 25-40          |
\| **Instagram**| 70,000 - 150,000  | 7 PM - 9 PM           | Ages 18-35          |


Customer Query: "Can you give me the steps to optimize my post for engagement?"
chatbot response:
\| **Step** | **Action**                                               |
\|----------|----------------------------------------------------------|
\| 1        | Use high-quality images or videos to grab attention.      |
\| 2        | Include relevant hashtags to reach a wider audience.      |
\| 3        | Post during peak engagement times based on your audience. |
\| 4        | Engage with comments to keep the conversation going.      |


### 3. Preceding Question Prompting:
This technique allows the chatbot to maintain context, particularly in social media settings where users may have multiple interactions.

Example Prompts and Responses:

Customer Query 1: "When is the best time to post on Facebook?"

Chatbot Response: "The best time is typically 9 AM to 12 PM for maximum engagement."

Customer Query 2 (Follow-up after providing information on Facebook): "How about Instagram?"

Chatbot Response: "For Instagram, the best time is 7 PM to 9 PM. I can also help you with hashtags or content optimization if needed."
### Conclusion:
This experiment successfully demonstrated the application of diverse prompting techniques within a social media management chatbot to improve the customer experience. The key techniques employed include:

Straightforward Prompts: Efficient for answering common customer queries quickly.

Tabular Format Prompting: Ideal for presenting structured information such as platform comparisons, post optimization steps, and troubleshooting procedures.

Preceding Question Prompting: Effective for ensuring continuity and relevance in chatbot interactions across multiple queries, enhancing contextual understanding.
## Result:
Thus the Prompts were exected succcessfully .
